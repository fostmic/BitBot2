Bitcoin Trading Bot for Coinbase Exchange

This is a bitcoin trading bot that I wrote for the Coinbase Exchange.  The bot buys and sells bitcoin on a sliding scale based on set investment targets relative to the logarithm of the market price.

NOTE: SINCE MY LAST UPDATE, COINBASE EXCHANGE HAS BECOME GDAX AND HAS MADE SOME CHANGES TO THEIR EXCHANGE API.  UPDATES ARE REQUIRED FOR THIS CODE IN ORDER TO MAKE IT FUNCTIONAL AGAIN.  I ASSUME NO LIABILITY FOR ANYONE WHO CHOOSES TO MAKE USE OF THIS CODE IN ANY WAY.  THIS WAS ORIGINALLY WRITTEN FOR PERSONAL USE ONLY.  SECURITY UPDATES ARE NEEDED FOR PRODUCTION RELEASE. NOTABLY IN THE STORAGE OF API KEYS.
