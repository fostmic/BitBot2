Bitcoin Trading Bot for Coinbase Exchange

This is a bitcoin trading bot that I wrote for the Coinbase Exchange.  The bot would buy and sell bitcoin on a sliding scale based on set investment targets relative to the logarithm of the market price.  A while ago I came to the decision that bitcoin was no longer a worthwhile investment.  This was due to multiple factors, however the biggest factor in my mind boils down to a major scaling problem that has been known about for years, however the decentralized nature of the protocol makes change very hard and consensus is almost impossible to achieve, especially with bad actors in the form of mining cartels working against a solution to keep transaction fees high.  The thing that bitcoin was created to fight against in the first place.

Do I think cryptocurrencies are going anywhere? No.  I think they are a revolutionary idea that will stick around.  However I think Bitcoin will be the myspace of the crypto world.  Eventually everyone will move on to something else.  So I'm waiting for a big crash in bitcoin once people get fed up with the huge fees before I move on to something else.

NOTE: SINCE MY LAST UPDATE, COINBASE EXCHANGE HAS BECOME GDAX AND HAS MADE SOME CHANGES TO THEIR EXCHANGE API.  UPDATES ARE REQUIRED FOR THIS CODE IN ORDER TO MAKE IT FUNCTIONAL AGAIN.  I ASSUME NO LIABILITY FOR ANYONE WHO CHOOSES TO MAKE USE OF THIS CODE IN ANY WAY.  THIS WAS ORIGINALLY WRITTEN FOR PERSONAL USE ONLY.  SECURITY UPDATES ARE NEEDED FOR PRODUCTION RELEASE. NOTABLY IN THE STORAGE OF API KEYS.
